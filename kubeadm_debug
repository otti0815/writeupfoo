[init] This might take a minute or longer if the control plane images have to be pulled.

Unfortunately, an error has occurred:
	timed out waiting for the condition

This error is likely caused by:
	- The kubelet is not running
	- The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)
	- Either there is no internet connection, or imagePullPolicy is set to "Never",
	  so the kubelet cannot pull or find the following control plane images:
		- k8s.gcr.io/kube-apiserver-amd64:v1.10.3
		- k8s.gcr.io/kube-controller-manager-amd64:v1.10.3
		- k8s.gcr.io/kube-scheduler-amd64:v1.10.3
		- k8s.gcr.io/etcd-amd64:3.1.12 (only if no external etcd endpoints are configured)

If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
	- 'systemctl status kubelet'
	- 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'
couldn't initialize a Kubernetes cluster


I had the same problem, cancelled and ran reset and then the same init as previously but with --apiserver-advertise-address=<my_host_public_ip_address> -- and it worked.
